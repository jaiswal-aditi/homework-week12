/*
Write a C program that simulates a simple timecard calculator. The user will input the clock-in
and clock-out times in 12-hour format with AM/PM. The program should compute the total
duration worked during a shift, even if the shift spans past midnight. It must output the 
total time worked as a duration in hours, minutes, and seconds, without referencing AM/PM.

* The program must accept two-time inputs - start of shift and end of shift
  **Input must be in 12-hour format with AM/PM:-  format -  HH MM SS AM/PM
* Output the total duration worked in HH:MM:SS format (24-hour style, no AM/PM).
* Shfts can span across midnight.
* program assumes all shifts occur within a 24-hour window (no multi-day shifts)

** See PDF for sample input/output
