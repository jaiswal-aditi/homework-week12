/*
Write a C program that simulates a simple timecard calculator. The user will input the clock-in
and clock-out times in 12-hour format with AM/PM. The program should compute the total
duration worked during a shift, even if the shift spans past midnight. It must output the 
total time worked as a duration in hours, minutes, and seconds, without referencing AM/PM.

* The program must accept two-time inputs - start of shift and end of shift.
* 

** See PDF for sample input/output
